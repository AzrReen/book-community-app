By integrating marketplace functionality with social interaction, Biblioo aims to simplify the process of discovering books, connecting with fellow readers, and giving physical books a second life. The system leverages Firebase services for user authentication, real-time data storage, image handling, and in-app messaging, ensuring a scalable and responsive user experience.
